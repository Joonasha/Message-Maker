# Message-Maker
Web page made with React. User is able to view, delete, and like messages. User can also sort messages and create own messages. Not implemented for the mobile view but seems to work well with desktop view in the web browser.

Web page can found from here: https://message-maker-api-02.herokuapp.com/
